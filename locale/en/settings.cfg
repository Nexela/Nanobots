[mod-setting-description]
nanobots-nanobots-auto=Nanobot emitter is automatic, Disabling will require shooting nanobots into an area. (Not Available Yet)
nanobots-network-limits=Check for existing logistic networks before dispatching nanobots.
nanobots-player-cycle-rate=How often in ticks to search for nanobot orders.
nanobots-queued-actions-per-cycle=How many actions are queued per player for each cycle.
nanobots-queued-actions-per-group=How many actions are queued in each tick group.
nanobots-ticks-between-action-groups=Tick delay between each group of actions.
nanobots-indside-area-radius=How far away you can be from a queued entity before it is canceled.
nanobots-equipment-auto=Nano Power armor equipment is automatic, Disabling will require using items to active. (Not Available Yet)
nanobots-build-tiles=Nanobots can be used to build tiles.
nanobots-afk-time=How long in seconds to be afk before nanbots shut down. 0 to never shutdown.
nanobots-fullfill-requests=Nanobots will attempt to fullfill request proxies.
nanobots-active-emitter-mode=Nano Emitter must be the selected weapon in order for nanobots to operate.
