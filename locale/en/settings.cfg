[mod-setting-description]
nanobots-nanobots-auto=Nanobot emitter is automatic, Disabling will require shooting nanobots into an area. (Not Available Yet)
nanobots-network-limits=Check for existing logistic networks before dispatching nanobots.
nanobots-nano-poll-rate=How often in ticks to search for nanobot orders, One player is done each tick.
nanobots-nano-queue-rate=Rate in ticks between queue actions.
nanobots-nano-queue-per-cycle=Number of entities queued per cycle.
nanobots-indside-area-radius=How far away you can be from a queued entity before it is cancled.
nanobots-cell-queue-rate=Rate in ticks between checking roboports queued by the roboport interface.
nanobots-free-bots-per=Percentage of available construction bots needed for roboport interface to queue actions.
nanobots-equipment-auto=Nano Power armor equipment is automatic, Disabling will require using items to active. (Not Available Yet)
nanobots-nano-build-tiles=Nanobots can be used to build tiles.
nanobots-afk-time=How long in seconds to be afk before nanobots shut down. 0 to never shutdown.
nanobots-nano-fullfill-requests=Nanobots will attempt to fullfill request proxies.
nanobots-active-emitter-mode=Nano Emitter must be the selected weapon in order for nanobots to operate.
nanobots-ammo-size-construction=Number of construction bots per ammo.
nanobots-ammo-size-termite=Number of termite bots per ammo.
nanobots-ammo-stack-size-construction=Stack size of nanobot construction ammo.
nanobots-ammo-stack-size-termite=Stack size of nanobot termite ammo.
