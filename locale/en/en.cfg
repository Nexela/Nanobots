[item-description]
gun-nano-emitter=Automatically sends out preprogrammed nanobots based on ammo type as long as the Nano emitter is the currently selected weapon. Nanobots do not work in existing logistic networks.
ammo-nano-termites=Destroys tree in range. Does not return items.
ammo-nano-scrappers=Destroys any entities marked for deconstruction in range. Does not return items
ammo-nano-deconstructors=Deconstructs any entities marked for deconstruction in range. Will return items to you.
ammo-nano-constructors=Revives entity ghosts in range if you have the entitys place item in your inventory. Also repairs damaged entities.
equipment-bot-chip-items=Configures personal roboports to automatically mark items on the ground for pickup. Must be in a network with available robots. Items do not get marked if enemies are around.
equipment-bot-chip-trees=Configures personal roboports to automatically mark trees in range for deconstruction. Must be in a network with available robots. Items do not get marked if enemies are around.
equipment-bot-chip-launcher=Configures personal roboports to automatically start launching combat units from inventory when enemies are inside range. Requires a personal roboport to work.
equipment-bot-chip-feeder=Emergency feeder, will automatically use healing items when your health is low, each feeder has a 2 minute cooldown. Requires a personal roboport to work.
equipment-bot-chip-nanointerface=Allows nanobots to work inside logistic cells. Only 1 chip is needed.
roboport-interface-main=Interfaces with the nearest logistic network to assign jobs.
